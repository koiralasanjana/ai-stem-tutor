<strong><h1>Project Objectives</h1></strong>
The Personalized AI Tutor for STEM Education for Girls aims to create an accessible, interactive, and adaptive learning platform to engage young girls in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math) education. The platform will empower users by providing personalized learning experiences, fostering self-confidence, and promoting gender equity in education. The project aligns with UN Sustainable Development Goal 5â€”Gender Equality, focusing on the empowerment of women and girls through education.

<strong><h2>Key Objectives:</h2></strong>
<strong>Empower Girls in STEM:</strong>
Create a supportive platform that encourages and motivates young girls to engage with STEM subjects. The app will serve as a bridge to overcoming stereotypes and barriers girls face in STEM fields.

<strong>Personalized Learning Paths:</strong>
Leverage adaptive learning algorithms to offer personalized lesson plans based on individual student progress, learning styles, and difficulty levels. This ensures that no student is left behind, and every girl receives the support she needs to succeed.

<strong>Increase Accessibility:</strong>
Ensure the platform is available and effective for girls from diverse geographical locations and socio-economic backgrounds. This includes providing a mobile-friendly interface and offline features for areas with limited internet access.

<strong>Foster Confidence:</strong>
Build a system that offers real-time, positive reinforcement and motivation. Through encouraging feedback, rewards, and continuous support, the tutor will help girls gain confidence in their STEM skills and abilities.

<strong>Multilingual Support:</strong>
Offer the platform in multiple languages to make STEM education accessible to girls worldwide. This feature is critical for reaching girls in regions with language barriers or where English is not the primary language.
